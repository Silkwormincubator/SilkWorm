# SilkWorm
A newly Monitoring Environmental Conditions System is proposed based on Raspberry-Pi. 
This proposal monitors the temperature, humidity, and luminosity in a silkworm incubator. 
The monitoring data are collected and save in the cloud for the subsequent analysis. 
The monitoring environmental system is based on Raspberry Pi due to capabilities, features, and low cost. 
The preliminary tests were realized in a real scenery and the results demonstrating its reliability.
