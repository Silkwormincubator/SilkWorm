// steps to install dht22 temperature and humidity sensor on raspberry pi
// operating system must be debian
// this code was tested on Rasoberry pi 3


Start by updating and upgrading the Raspberry Pi. 
Type following and press enter.

sudo apt-get update

This updates software sources then type following and press enter.

sudo apt-get upgrade

This updates to everything to latest version. If prompted to continue press "Y".
When these are finished, it is time to install Adafruit Python code.
You will need this code in order to get readings from DHT22 sensors. 
This will also allow you to test that your assembly works in first place.
At first, get compiler and python library. For that type following and press enter

sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-openssl

Then, make sure that you are in folder where you want to install the Adafruit code, by default i would suggest /home/. For that type following and press enter.

cd /home/pi

Now clone the git repository. Type following and press enter.

git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT.g...

Go to folder.Type following and press enter.

cd Adafruit_Python_DHT

And finally install the Adafruit library. Type following and press enter.

sudo python setup.py install

Then it is time to test your assembly...
Step 8: Testing the DHT22's
Now that installation is completed you can test the connected sensor/s and s
ee that you get reading from them. Go to folder where you cloned 
the Adafruit_Python_DHT and then to examples folder. Type following and press enter.

cd /home/pi/Adafruit_Python_DHT/examples

You remember the gpio/s where you plugged the sensor/s? Good, 
then type sudo ./AdafruitDHT.py and press enter. I had gpio 22 and 23 so I tested with

sudo ./AdafruitDHT.py 22 22

sudo ./AdafruitDHT.py 22 23

If your sensor and assembly is ok, you should get back temperature 
and humidity from the sensor/s. Like seen in attached image.

NOTE:

If you see "Failed to get reading. Try again!", then try again few times.

If still nothing, re-check that you typed in the right GPIO.

If gpio is for sure right, check your assembly again. E.g. 
DHT22 gets power, ground and resistor is connected correctly.

If all above are right, try to connect your sensor to another GPIO and see if you get reading from that

If nothing from above works, it is always possible that your DHT22 is broken. :(

Libraries for DHT22 sensors are now installed and you can get the readings from sensor/s.
